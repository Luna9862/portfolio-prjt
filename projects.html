            <h3>Favorite Recipe project <h3>
            </div>
            <p>In my favorite recipe project we created a web page that contains three pages. In each page has its own content, such as as the index.file contains information of why I chose this specific recipe. The ingredients page contains information of the ingredients required to make Fruit Cream Salad. Then the 'Lets cook!" page contains information on how to make the Fruit Cream Salad. The final page Greetings contains text boxes for the guests to enter there personal information as well as any questions they may have. </p>

                <p> In the CSS-properties activty I created a web page with information about my dogs. Within, the project there were some requirements that helped me understand how to code in css. Using @keyframes in one of the images to give the image a rotating effect.</p>

                <p>In the Github group project, I searched up an image and using its link added it into the group repo Justice made. In Github group I learned how to work as a team and communicate the troublesome we may have had upon adding our own inforation on the group project.</p>
